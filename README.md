## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to get exposed to working with large datasets. In this project, we aim to build and deploy ensembles machine learning models in the cloud and  compare the output of different climate models to actual observed rainfall. The output is features of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation. The data set for this project is approximately ~12 GB [Daily rainfall over NSW, Australia](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).
